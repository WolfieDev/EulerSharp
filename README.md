Project Euler problems in C#

Hello! My name is Paco and I am a junior developer from Spain. 
I have recently finished my studies and am currently working on software development at C#.
To improve and maintain my development skills, I decided to start this small project in which I will try to solve as many problems as possible in the language mentioned above.
For those who do not know "Project Euler", it is a project that consists of mathematical problems focused on solving through programming. 
Obviously, I will not develop many of the problems in the most optimal and efficient way, so any suggestions or improvements for the project are welcome. Also you can e-mail me to: wdev@outlook.es

I'm developing this project with **monodevelop** running under **Manjaro**

Best regards.
